# Fruit Samurai

*A fun pixel art game about slicing fruits.*

## Installation

Download all files into one folder and run app.py. You may need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure you have the required version of Pillow.

For full immersion, installation of the `arcade.ttf` font is recommended.

## Features

* **Lightweight**: As part of the constraints of the assignment, the entire program was developed on just **Tkinter** and **PIL**.
* **Endless Gameplay**: The game has no end and it will dynamically react to your performance and change the difficulty.
* **Leaderboard**: Keep track of your top scores with a csv file. A web-hosted database leaderboard is coming soon.
* **Save and Load**: Pause at any time and save your progress. Load right back into the action when you're ready.
* **Custom Keybinds**: There are customisable controls to pause and for the [boss key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_key).
* **Cheat Codes**: There are fun easter-eggs and cheatcodes activated with the arrow-keys. Be warned: cheating will exclude your result from the leaderboard.

## How to Play

* Move the cursor over the fruit objects to slice them. 
* The quicker you swipe through the fruit, the more points you get!
* Golden apples will give you an extra life.
* Slicing the bombs loses you a life.

## Acheivements

* I learned how to develop readable and robust code by adhering to **PEP8** standards.

* Developed strong **OOP** experience in **Python**

* Scored **89%** where the average mark was 57%.
